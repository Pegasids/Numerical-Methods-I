1. For the forward differences formula,
   h = 0.01 has the most accurate and smoothest approximation.
   
2. Similarly, for the centred differences formula,
   h = 0.01 has the most accurate and smoothest approximation.

In general, the smaller h is, the better the approximation becomes.
Comparing these two, the centred diffences formula is more accurate;
It has error of o(h^2), where as the forward diffences formula has
error of o(h).
